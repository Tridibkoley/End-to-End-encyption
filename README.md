🎨 Clean, responsive UI

🧩 Purely frontend (no server-side dependency)

🧪 Easy to test and modify for learning encryption basics

📸 Screenshots
(Insert screenshots here if available — UI, message send flow, encryption preview, etc.)

🔒 How It Works
Each message is encrypted on the sender’s end using a shared secret key.

The encrypted text is then displayed/sent.

The recipient decrypts the message using the same key.

All encryption/decryption occurs in the browser.
